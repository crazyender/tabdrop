# TabDrop

A plugin for vim to provide "tab drop" for vim not built with GUI.

## Usage

The same as ":tab drop file" but works in terminal vim.
```
:TabDrop file
```

Like ":tab drop file" but when the file is already open in a tab then move it before the current tab before selecting it.
```
:TabDropHere file
```
